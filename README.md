# conan

This project provides Dockerfiles for creating images for building C/C++
projects using the Conan package manager and compilers.

These images are based off of
[conan-docker-tools](https://github.com/conan-io/conan-docker-tools.git) but
add additional dependencies required for building dependencies such as Qt.
